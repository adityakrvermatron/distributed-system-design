    " # Designing an API Rate Limiter\n",
    "\n",
    "An API reate limiter will throttle users based on the number of requests they are sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Rate Limiting?\n",
    "Rate limiting is all about traffic/load management. Clients can misbehave and trigger a retry storm, others might request the same information over and over again, increasing traffic and unnecessary load on the system. This can degrade the performance of the service, and the ability of the system to reliably handle incoming requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting helps to protect services against abusive behaviors targeting the application such as retry storms, Denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, brute-force password attempts, brute-force credit card transactions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting saves the company money by eliminating service and infrastructure costs that would have otherwise been used to handle spamming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some scenarios to show the importance of Rate limiting our API/Services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prevents service degradation:** It reduces traffic spikes so that the service stays reliable for all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misbehaving clients:** Sometimes, clients can overwhelm servers by sending large number of requests, either intentionally or unintentionally. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security:** Limiting the number of times a user should authenticate with a wrong password.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preventing abusive and bad design practices:** Without API limits, developers of client apps might request the same info over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue:**  Services can limit operations based on the tier of their customer's service and thus create a revenue model off the rate limiting. To go beyond the set limit, the user has to buy higher limits. \n"

    "## 3. Algorithms used for Rate Limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed Window Algorithm\n",
    "Here, the time window is considered from the start of the time-unit to the end of the time-unit. \n",
    "For instance, a period will be considered 0-60 sec for a minute regardless of the time frame at which the API request has been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows that we will only throttle 'm5' message, if our rate limit is 2 messages per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/fixed_rolling_window.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rolling Window Algorithm\n",
    "The time window is considered from the fraction of time at which the request is made plus the time window length.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a rate limit of 2 messages per second, the two messages sent at the 300th millisecond (m1) and 400th millisecond (m2), we'll count them as two messages starting from the 300th of that second to the 300th of the next second (making up one second).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we will therefore throttle M3, M4 as shown above.\n",

    "## 5. Basic System Design and Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume for each user, our rate limiter allows 3 requests/sec. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each user, store:\n",
    "- a request count (how many requests the user has made)\n",
    "- a timestamp when we started counting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep this in a hashtable, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#  Key (userID): Value {count, start_time}\n",
    "hashtable = {\n",
    "    'userId0': {\n",
    "        'count': 3, 'start_time': 1574866492\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    'userId1': {\n",
    "        'count': 1, 'start_time': 1574873716\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new request comes in, the rate limiter will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the `userID` does not exist in the hash-table, \n",
    "    - insert it, \n",
    "    - set `count` to 1 and set `start_time` to current epoch time\n",
    "2. Otherwise, find the existing record of the userID, and \n",
    "    - if `current_time - start_time >= 1 minute`, reset `start_time` to be current time, \n",
    "    - set `count` to 1 and allow the request\n",
    "3. If `current_time - start_time <= 1 minute` and\n",
    "    - If `count < 3`, increment the count and allow the request.\n",
    "    - If `count == 3`, reject the request.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Problems with this Fixed Window Algorithm\n",
    "1. We are resetting the `start_time` at the end of every minute, which means we can potentially allow twice the number of requests per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if a user sends 3 requests at the last second of a minute, they can immediately send 3 more requests at the very first second of the next minute, resulting in 6 requests in a span of two seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this loophole, we'll use the sliding-window algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/fixed_window_problem.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Atomicity: The read and then write process can create a race condition. Imagine, a given user's current count = 2. If two seperate processes served each of these requests and concurrently read the count before either updated it, each process would erroneously think that the user had one more request to hit the rate limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/fixed_window_atomicity.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solutions\n",
    "We can use a K-V store like Redis to store our key-value and solve the atomicity problem using [Redis lock](https://redis.io/topics/distlock) for the duration of the read-update operation. \n",
    "This however, would slow down concurrent requests from the same user and introduce another layer of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How much memory to store all the user data?\n",
    "Assume the userID takes 8 bytes, epoch time needs 4 bytes, 2 bytes for count:\n",
    "```\n",
    "8 + 2 + 4 = 14 bytes\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's assume our hash-table has an overhead of 30 bytes for each record. If we need to track 10 million users at any time:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total memory =  (14 + 30) bytes * 10 million users = 440,000,000 bytes => 440MB memory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that we need a 4-byte number to lock each user's record to solve the atomicity problems\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total memory =  4 bytes for lock + (14 + 30) bytes * 10 million users = 480,000,000 bytes => 480MB memory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can fit in a single server. However, we wouldn't want to route all traffic in a single machine because of availability issue => that one server goes down for any reason, our only instance of the rate limiter service goes down with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when rate limiting 1M users at 10 req/sec, this would be about 10 million queries per second for our rate limiter. This would be too much to handle for a single server. Practically, we can use Redis or Memcached in a distributed setup. We'll store all the data in remote Redis servers and all the Rate limiter servers will read/update these servers before serving or throttling any request.\n",

    "2. Count elements in the set. Reject request if the count is greater than our throttling limit (3 for our case).\n",
    "3. Insert current time in the sorted set and accept the request.\n",

    "#### Memory for storing user data?\n",
    "Assume UserId takes 8 bytes, each epoch time takes 4 bytes.\n",
